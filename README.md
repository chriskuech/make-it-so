# *"Make it so!"* 🗨️👨‍🦲

This repo is a Proof of Concept for implementing the [Requirements][Requirements] in a type-safe General Purpose Programming Language.  [Requirements][Requirements] is a PowerShell module for declaratively orchestrating multistep infrastructure configurations.

## Features
* Declare complex systems and idempotently "make it so".
* Simple alternative to big configuration systems (ex: Chef, Ansible, etc.)
    * Small enough to understand the code base.
    * Portable enough to run on any automation platform.
* Automatic consistent logging/tracing, with hooks for custom loggers.
* Opensourceable (`make-it-so` is free in `npm` 😉)
* :star: Strongly typed state handling.
* :star: Parallel execution.
* :star: Clearly limit and trace how and when state is modified.

:star: Not available with [Requirements][Requirements]
